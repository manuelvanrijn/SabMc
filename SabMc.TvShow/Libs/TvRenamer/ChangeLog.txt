Changes:

1.2.0.0:
===========================================================================
1) Added auto-update mechanism (checks external site and notifies user in 
   script output.
2) Totally refactored the internal workings of the workflow to make the 
   code easier to modify and also to allow more unit testing (there are now
   60 unit tests for the entire project). What that means for you the user:
   the code is far less likely to have significant bugs and less likely
   for regressions to occur as they will be immediately caught before
   deploying a new version.
3) Added Linux support! Had reworked the workflow to use Microsoft's
   Windows Workflow Foundation, but Mono has incomplete support for it.
   Wrote a custom workflow to allow for Mono to work on Linux/Mac. Tested
   on Ubuntu 9.10, which has Mono built in, and it works great.
   
   This may allow the software to work on Mac as well, but I do not have 
   a Mac on which to test the software.
4) User can test TV Rage and the parsing algorithm by using the /test 
   command line parameter (e.g. TvRenamer.exe /test)

1.1.2.0:
===========================================================================
1) Convert forward slashes (/) to backslashes (\) in patterns, because 
   users converting from SABnzbd's patterns may have forward slashes, but 
   Windows does not support this as a path separator. Per user request:

2) Added default feature to update directory write times to show a file in 
   the folder or one of the sub-folders has been updated. Will help in 
   sorting by modified date by folder. Per user request:

1.1.1.0:
===========================================================================
1) Added an OfflineTvQueryService engine to guess at the show title with 
   proper casing (e.g. "The Show Name by Somebody" rather than "the show 
   name by somebody") if TVRage is offline or reports that the show was 
   not found (TVRage is slow and unreliable sometimes).

1.1.0.0:
===========================================================================
1) Added a search and replace engine and documentation in ReadMe.txt
2) Fixed bug in TVRage retry code (would only retry once no matter what)
3) Changed TVRage defaults (40 seconds / 5 tries)

1.0.0.0:
===========================================================================
1) Initial creation of SABnzbd Automatic TV Renamer project.
2) Parses command line to retrieve SABnzbd passed parameters.
3) Queries TVRage to determine show title, episode number, episode title,
   episode number, and air date.
4) Renames files according to patterns.
5) Moves and removes directories according to user preferences.
6) Created initial documentation readme.txt
