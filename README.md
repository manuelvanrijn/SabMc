#SabNzbd XBMC processing
##What?
Two simple scripts for processing TV Shows and Movies after SabNzbd finished downloading. 

##How?
Only thing you really have to do is edit two config's to match your needs

Dont forget to edit the TvRenamer.exe.config located in

    SabMc.TvShow\Libs\TvRenamer\TvRenamer.exe.config

##Note!
At this point only the TV Show script is finished!

##Whats next?
