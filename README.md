#SabNzbd XBMC processing
##What?

Two simple scripts for processing TV Shows and Movies after SabNzbd finished downloading and a simple Notifo script.

##How?

Step 1 - Run build.bat

Step 2 - Copy the files from the /release/ to the SabNzbd user script folder

Step 3 - Run the "SabMc.Movie.exe" or "SabMc.TvShow.exe" to create te config. You'll see:

    INFO: Config file created, please fill it :)

Step 4 - Edit the just created "config.xml" TvRenamer.exe.config

    /config.xml
    /Libs/TvRenamer/TvRenamer.exe.config

Step 5 - Set the user script to point to the right SabMc exe file

##Note/TODO

- At this point only the TV Show script is finished!
- DOCUMENTATION! For now I just did some fast coding... 

##Whats next?

Developing the movie script for processing movie's downloaded with SabNzbd
