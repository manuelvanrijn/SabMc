#SabNzbd XBMC processing
##What?

Three SabNzbd processing scripts:

- SabMC.TvShow - Processes downloaded tvshows
- SabMC.Movie - Processes downloaded movies
- SabMC.Notifo - Just sends a notification when the download is finished

##Get Started

- Step 2 - Copy the files from the /release/ to the SabNzbd user script folder
- Step 3 - Run on of the executables to create te config. You'll see:

    INFO: Config file created, please fill it :)

- Step 4 - Edit the just created config.xml and the TvRenamer.exe.config

    /config.xml
    /Libs/TvRenamer/TvRenamer.exe.config

- Step 5 - Setup SabNZBD to point to the right executable.
